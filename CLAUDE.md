# LotLogic - Project Context & Learnings

## What This Is
AI-powered parking enforcement platform. Cameras detect vehicles in zones, create violations, operators take action (boot/tow/dismiss).

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React SPA in `frontend/index.html`, deployed on Vercel (auto-deploys from `main` branch, root dir: `frontend/`)
  - Live URL: `https://lotlogic-beta.vercel.app`
  - Vercel project: `lotlogic` on team `gabebs1-2452s-projects`
- **Backend**: Python API on Railway at `https://lotlogic-backend-production.up.railway.app`
  - Backend modules (notifications, violation dedup) live in `backend/`
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) at `https://nzdkoouoaedbbccraoti.supabase.co`
- **Snapshot Puller**: Async camera polling service in `puller/`, deployed as Railway worker
- **Monitoring**: Python agent system in `monitoring/` with Claude AI analysis (containerized)
- **Detection Pipeline**: Camera RTSP -> Snapshots (30s poll) -> YOLO + Plate Recognizer -> Zone filtering -> Violation creation

## Key Tables
- `cameras` - IP cameras with RTSP URLs, zones (JSONB), resolution settings
- `snapshots` - Camera captures with `raw_detections` JSONB and `vehicles_detected` count
- `violations` - Detected violations with `confidence`, `plate_confidence`, `zone_id`, `camera_id`, `zone_overlap`
- `lots` - Parking lots linked to owners and partners
- `partners` - Enforcement operators with fee schedules and revenue share

## Detection Pipeline Gotchas & Learnings

### Issue: Zones Not Detecting Violations (March 2025)
**Root cause**: Cowork identified that zones weren't picking up violations. Multiple potential causes:
1. **Camera too far from zone** - YOLO bounding boxes become too small at distance, confidence drops below threshold
2. **Confidence threshold too aggressive** - If backend filters detections above a certain confidence, close-but-not-perfect detections get dropped
3. **Zone polygon mismatch** - Zone polygons drawn in the UI (percentage-based 0-100 SVG coords) may not align with where vehicles actually appear in the camera frame
4. **Resolution too low** - At 640x360 (default), plates become unreadable at distance. Plate Recognizer needs clear character rendering
5. **Snapshot-to-violation gap** - Camera sees vehicles (vehicles_detected > 0 in snapshots) but violation engine doesn't create violations if zone overlap check fails

### Zone Matching: IoU Bounding Box Overlap (Upgraded March 2025)
The backend violation engine matches detections to zones using **IoU-style bounding box overlap**.
A detection's bbox must overlap the zone polygon by at least **30%** (configurable via `ZONE_IOU_THRESHOLD`
env var) to count as a match. If a detection overlaps multiple zones, it's assigned to the zone with
the highest overlap percentage.

This replaced the previous center-point-in-polygon approach which caused repeated production failures
(e.g., zone 7 had vehicles overlapping by 47% but centroid landing 0.003 outside the boundary).

- **Overlap threshold**: 30% default (`ZONE_IOU_THRESHOLD` env var, 0-1 scale)
- **`zone_overlap` column** on `violations` table stores the overlap percentage (0-1 scale)
- The dedup system weights presence scoring by overlap — higher overlap = stronger presence signal
- Zone polygons still use **0-1 normalized coords** in the DB
- Detection bboxes still use **0-1 normalized** `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`
- **Raw detections have `zone_id: none`** — zone matching happens in the violation engine, not at snapshot level

**Historical note**: The Z1/Z7 centroid gap issues (March 2025) are fully resolved by IoU matching —
vehicles no longer need their exact center point inside the zone, just sufficient bounding box overlap.

### Zone Guardian Agent (Updated March 2025)
`monitoring/zone_guardian.py` — Autonomous agent that runs every 10 minutes, scans ALL cameras/lots,
and monitors IoU overlap quality for all zone-detection pairs:
- **low_overlap_risk**: Vehicles overlap zone between 10-30% — below IoU threshold, no violations created
- **threshold_borderline**: Vehicles at 30-35% overlap — zone works but fragile to camera shifts
- **near_miss**: Vehicles detected near zone but not overlapping at all
- **zone_too_small**: Zone polygon too small for reliable overlap matching

**Auto-fix mode**: `--auto-fix` flag automatically patches zone polygons via the backend API,
expanding them to increase overlap above the 30% IoU threshold.

**Usage**:
- `python zone_guardian.py --scan` — single scan
- `python zone_guardian.py --daemon` — continuous monitoring (every 10 min)
- `python zone_guardian.py --scan --auto-fix` — scan and auto-patch zones
- `python zone_guardian.py --scan --camera-id <uuid>` — scan specific camera

### Detection Monitoring System (Added March 2025)
`monitoring/agent_tools.py` -> `check_zone_detection_health()` now automatically detects:
- **Silent zones**: Online camera with zones configured but zero violations ever
- **Detection dropoff**: Zone had violations in 7-day window but zero in last 24h
- **Confidence skew (high)**: Avg confidence > 95% means over-filtering, missing borderline violations
- **Confidence skew (low)**: Avg confidence < 30% means bad angle/distance/obstruction
- **Vehicles seen but no violations**: Snapshots detect vehicles but violation engine creates nothing
- **Low resolution risk**: Camera resolution below 640x360 minimum
- **No zones configured**: Camera online and taking snapshots but no zones defined

### Auto-Diagnosis System (Updated March 2025)
`monitoring/agent_tools.py` -> `diagnose_zone_issues()` goes deeper — compares actual detection
bounding boxes against zone polygons from recent snapshots to find WHY zones fail:
- **low_overlap**: Vehicles overlap zone but below the 30% IoU threshold (zone too small or offset)
- **overlap_borderline**: Vehicles at 30-40% overlap — zone works but fragile to camera changes
- **zone_near_miss**: Vehicles detected NEAR zone but not overlapping (zone needs shifting)
- **zone_no_vehicles**: Zone in area where no vehicles appear in frame
- **zone_too_small**: Zone covers < 0.5% of frame, unreliable matching
- **invalid_polygon**: Zone has < 3 polygon points

### Database Schema vs Code Gotchas
- `cameras` table does NOT have an `online` column — use `status` and `active` instead
- Camera status values: `active` (not `online` as in supabase-schema.sql)
- Zone polygon coords are **0-1 normalized** in the DB, not 0-100 percentage
- Detection bboxes are also **0-1 normalized** `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`
- Camera has `resolution_width`/`resolution_height` AND `snapshot_width`/`snapshot_height` columns

### Key Thresholds
- **Zone IoU threshold**: 30% default (`ZONE_IOU_THRESHOLD` env var) — minimum bbox overlap to match a zone
- Plate recognition alarm: < 20% = critical, < 50% = warning
- Camera heartbeat staleness: 10 minutes
- Confidence display: green > 0.8, yellow 0.5-0.8, red < 0.5
- Snapshot poll interval: 30 seconds default

## Revenue Model
- `gross_revenue` = boot_fee ($75 default) or tow_fee ($250 default)
- `our_revenue` = gross_revenue * revenue_share (30% default)
- Revenue stored in dollars in DB, displayed as cents in frontend (multiplied by 100)

## Security Notes
- Property access control rolled out (Apr 2026): owners/partners authenticate with email + password against the backend `/auth/login`, which returns a JWT signed with `JWT_SECRET` (set to the Supabase JWT secret). The frontend forwards the token to both the backend and Supabase, so RLS and API routes enforce the same account → property mapping.
- Shared X-API-Key remains for service-to-service callers (puller, monitoring, leadgen). It is no longer shipped in the dashboard bundle.
- RLS policies live in `lotlogic-backend/migrations/20260417025411_rls_property_scope.sql` (SELECT-only, keyed on JWT claims `owner_id` / `partner_id`).

## Testing
- Playwright harness in `tests/` — access-control E2E, dashboard smoke, a11y sweep.
- `cd tests && npm ci && npx playwright install --with-deps chromium && npm test`.
- GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/playwright.yml` runs the suite on every push / PR against the Vercel preview or live beta.
- Seed test accounts via `ADMIN_API_KEY=… npm run seed` (requires backend `ADMIN_API_KEY` env var to be set — leave it empty in production).

### Backend & Workers — Railway
- **Backend**: FastAPI on Railway — auto-deploys from `getlotlogic/lotlogic-backend` repo
- **Puller**: `puller/Dockerfile` runs `async_puller.py` in python:3.12-slim (Railway worker)
- **Monitoring**: `monitoring/Dockerfile` runs agents in python:3.12-slim (Railway worker)
- **Migrations**: `puller/Dockerfile.migrate` runs one-shot schema patches
- Railway auto-deploys on push to main (each service has its own root directory)
- Use `make help` to see all build/run commands
- Each Railway service should have its root directory set to its subdirectory (e.g., `puller/`, `monitoring/`)

## Development Rules
- The frontend is a single `frontend/index.html` file (React + Babel transpiled in-browser)
- Zone coordinates are percentage-based (0-100) mapped to SVG viewBox
- All timestamps are UTC (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- Violation status is only 'pending' or 'resolved' (CHECK constraint)
- `action_taken` values: boot, tow, dismissed, already_gone, no_action, plate_correction
